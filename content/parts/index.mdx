# Parts

Parts are the physical items used in the harness, such as connectors, cables, or coverings. They are created and managed in the Parts view. Each Part contains specific properties like part number, manufacturer, colour etc. These properties are inherited by Components when a Part is assigned to them.

## Add a Part
