# Parts

**Parts** are the physical items used in the harnessâ€”such as connectors, cables, and coverings. They are created and managed in the **Parts View**.

Each part can have specific properties like part number, manufacturer, colour, and more. Parts are assigned to [components](/components), and once assigned, relevant properties are automatically validated. For example, a [connector part](/parts/part-connector) must have the same number of cavities as the [connector component](/components/component-connector) it is assigned to.

## Adding Parts

In the Parts View, right-click on the canvas or click the `+` button in the bottom-left corner to add a new part.

Click the dropdown arrow on the right side of a part row in the Parts table to expand and edit its properties.

## Assigning Parts

Parts are assigned to components in the [Layout](/quick-start/layout) or [Schematic](/quick-start/schematic) view. Right-click a component, then select the appropriate part from the list.
