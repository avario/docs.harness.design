# Updates
Development updates and release notes for Harness Design.
<br />

## Release - 07.01.2026

Few new features improving useability and layout in the app. Let us know what you think!

### Layout Points Wires

We added layout points to wires to allow some level of manual routing. This should help clean up complex schematics.
https://docs.harness.design/components/component-wire#layout-points

### Layout Points Bundles

These work similar to the layout points for wires but for bundles and replace the need to add extra branch points.
 https://docs.harness.design/components/component-bundle#layout-points

### Moving Groups

We've adjusted the way groups work so you can now move them by dragging on the heading.
https://docs.harness.design/components/component-group#moving-a-group

### Smaller Enhancements
- Fixed Cable Jumble Bug (took a while to hunt this one down!)
- Fixed bug where for one connector you could see two on the Layout View
- Fixed bug where cables were included in the group on the Layout View
- Fixed missing Net Labels from cavities in PDF
- Fixed cavity numbering issue in PDF
- Fixed bug when adding part to wire with stripe
- Fixed bug where right click didn't work after marque select

### Manual Cavity Numbering

You can adjust the cavity numbers by double clicking the number and typing in the value you want.
