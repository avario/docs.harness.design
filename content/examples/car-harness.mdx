# Car Harness

The following example shows a simplified car harness.

## Schematic

The following demonstrates the correct use of [Groups](/components/component-group) as [Devices](/parts/part-device), [Mating](/features/feature-mates) of [Connectors](/components/component-connector), and [Net Labels](/components/component-net-label), to create a clear and organized schematic.

## Layout

A fully routed car harness layout with [Bundle Lengths](/components/component-bundle#setting-bundle-lengths), [Devices](/parts/part-device), and [Mating](/features/feature-mates).

## Connections and Parts

The **Connections View** shows corresponding [Wire Parts](/parts/part-wire) from the **Parts View**, **From** and **To** generated from the labels entered into [Components](/components), [Net Labels](/components/component-net-label) applied in the **Schematic View**, and wire lengths generated from [Bundle Lengths](/components/component-bundle#setting-bundle-lengths) in the **Layout View**.

The **Parts View** shows a fully populated list of all parts used in the harness including [Devices](/parts/part-device), [Connectors](/parts/connector), [Wire Parts](/parts/part-wire), and [Contacts](/parts/connector/part-contact).
