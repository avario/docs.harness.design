# Validation

harness.design has several built-in tools to make sure your harness is built correctly.

## Wire Gauge
If the wire gauge does not match the properties of the contact, a warning is shown in the Schematic view.  
<br />  
<img src="/features/validate-guage.png" width={432} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />  
If multiple wires go into one contact, the sizes will be summed to calculate the total gauge.  
<br />  
<img src="/features/validate-guage-multiple.png" width={397} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />  
<Callout>  
Multiple wire gauges are calculated by converting `AWG` to `mm²`, adding them together, then converting back to `AWG`.  
</Callout>

## Connector Cavities
If the Connector Component and Connector Part do not match the number of cavities, a warning is shown in the Schematic view.  
<br />  
<img src="/features/validate-cavities.png" width={262} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />  
Parts with the same cavity count are suggested at the top of the parts list when assigning a part to a connector.

## Contact Compatibility
Contacts from the same manufacturer are suggested at the top of the parts list when assigning a contact to a connector.  
<br />  
<img src="/features/validate-contacts.png" width={572} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />

## Unassigned Wires
Wires with no part assigned to them are highlighted in the Connection view as `No Part`.  
<br />  
<img src="/features/validate-wire-part.png" width={800} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />

## Unassigned Lengths
Wires routed through bundles that have no length assigned to them are highlighted in the Connection view as `No Length`. Wires that are routed through bundles where one length is missing are prefixed with `≥` to indicate that the length is at least the length of the wire.  
<br />  
<img src="/features/validate-wire-length.png" width={800} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />

## Unassigned Parts
Parts that have not been assigned to components are highlighted in the Parts view as `Not Used`.  
<br />  
<img src="/features/validate-parts.png" width={800} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />
