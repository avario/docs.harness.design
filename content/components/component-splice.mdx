# Splice

A **splice** connects two or more wires within the harness. Each splice can be assigned a [splice part](/parts/part-splice).

## Adding a Splice

Right-click on the canvas in the [Schematic View](/quick-start/schematic) and select **Splice**.

## Locating a Splice

Splices are automatically positioned at branch points based on the most efficient wiring path. An automatically placed splice is shown with a dashed arrow line.

To position a **Splice** manually, drag its location handle in the Layout View to any branch point, connector, or terminal.
