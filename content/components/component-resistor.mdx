# Resistor
A resistor limits electrical current and drops voltage in a circuit

## Add a Resistor
Right click on the artboard on the Schematic view to add a Resistor

## Locate a Resistor
Resistor are located at branch points automatically in the harness based on the most efficent path for the wires. A Resistor placed automatically is shown by a dashed arrow line

Resistor can be located manually by dragging from the location bar on the Diode in the Layout view to any branch point, connector or terminal in the harness.
