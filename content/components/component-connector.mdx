# Connector

A **connector** joins electrical parts, allowing easy connection and disconnection of circuits. It serves as a termination point in the harness. Connectors can be assigned a [connector part](/parts/part-connector).

Connectors can have multiple **cavities**, and each cavity can be assigned a [contact part](/parts/part-contact).

## Adding a Connector

Right-click on the canvas in the [Schematic](/quick-start/schematic) or [Layout](/quick-start/layout) view and select **Connector**.
