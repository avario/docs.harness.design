# Connector

A **connector** joins electrical parts, allowing easy connection and disconnection of circuits. It serves as a termination point in the harness. Connectors can be assigned a [Connector Part](/parts/connector).

The following parts can be assigned to a **Connector**:
- [Contact Part](/parts/connector/part-contact) - **Connectors** can have multiple **cavities**, and each cavity can be assigned a **contact**.
- [Lock Part](/parts/connector/part-lock) - Some **connectors** require a **lock** to secure the contacts in place.
- [Dust Cover Part](/parts/connector/part-dust-cover) - A **dust cover** can be added to **connectors** to protect the contacts when unmated.
- [Boot Part](/parts/connector/part-boot) - A **boot**, which is soft, mounts to a **connector** for strain relief and sealing.
- [Backshell Part](/parts/connector/part-backshell) - A **backshell**, which is rigid, mounts to a **connector** for strain relief and sealing.

## Adding a Connector

Right-click on the canvas in the [Schematic](/quick-start/schematic) or [Layout](/quick-start/layout) view and select **Connector**.

## Adding and Removing Cavities

Select a connector in the Schematic view, then click the `+` or `–` buttons to add or remove cavities. Type in the number of cavities you want directly into the cavity count box to quickly set the number of cavities.

Shells can be connected to just like cavities.

## Editing Connector and Cavity Labels

Double-click any connector or cavity label to edit it.

## Adjust View Width of Connector

If the name or cavity labels are too long to fit, right-click the connector, select Width, and set the desired width.
