# Wire

A **wire** represents an electrical connection between two components in the harness. Each wire can be assigned a [wire part](/parts/part-wire).

## Adding a Wire

In the [Schematic View](/quick-start/schematic), drag from the connection handle of one component to another to create a wire.

## Assigning Colour

If no part is assigned to a **Wire**, you can manually set its colour. Right-click the wire in the Schematic, Layout, or Connection view and choose a **Colour** from the menu. More colors can be selected by clicking **More** at the bottom of the color list. The **Stripe** color can be assigned in the same way but selecting **Stripe** from the menu.

## Layout a Wire
To layout a **Wire** you use [Layout Points](/components/component-layout-point).

## Dimmed Wire Path

The **Dim path** feature improves schematic readability by visually breaking a **Wire**. This is useful when a **Wire** spans the full width of the schematic or crosses beneath other components. Dimming a wire has no effect on the physical harness and is purely for making the Schematic View visually cleaner.
<br />
To dim a wire path, right-click a wire and select **Dim path** from the dropdown menu.  
<br />

A **Dimmed Wire** will show up as two arrows connected by a faint bezier line.

[Layout Points](/components/component-layout-point) can be added to dimmed wires.

## Dashed Wires

Wires appear as dashed lines in the Schematic View when they are not yet routed through a bundle in the Layout View.  
<br />

<Callout>  
You can hide the dashed lines by de-selecting **Dash undefined routes** from the Schematic **View Options** menu.

## Jumper Wire

A **Jumper Wire** (loopback wire) can be created by dragging from one cavity to another within the same connector in the **Schematic View**.

<Callout>  
A **Jumper Wire** is considered to have a length of **zero**. You may need to account for this when generating length reports.
