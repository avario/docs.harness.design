# Wire
A wire is a connection inside the harness between two components.
## Add a Wire
Drag from the connection handle of one component to another component in the Schematic view to create a wire.

## Assign a [Wire Part](/parts/part-wire)
Right click on a wire in the Schematic, Layout or Connection view and select the Wire Part you want to assign

## Assign Colour
If no part is assigned to a wire, you can assign a colour to the wire by right clicking on the wire in the Schematic, Layout or Connection View. This color only applies to the wire in the Schematic and Layout views to help with visualisation.

## Wire Labels
Wire labels are added by right clicking a wire and selecting "Add labels" from the dropdown menu.

Wire labels are used to help with the readability of the Schematic view by allowing a wire to be broken. This is useful when a wire runs across the entire schematic. The labels have no effect on the physical harness and are only for visualisation purposes.

## Dashed Wires
Wires are shown as dashed lines in the Schematic view when they have not been routed through a bundle in the Layout view.
