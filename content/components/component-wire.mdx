# Wire

A **wire** represents an electrical connection between two components in the harness. Each wire can be assigned a [wire part](/parts/part-wire).

## Adding a Wire

In the [Schematic View](/quick-start/schematic), drag from the connection handle of one component to another to create a wire.

## Assigning Colour

If no part is assigned to a wire, you can manually set its colour. Right-click the wire in the Schematic, Layout, or Connection view and choose a colour from the menu.

## Layout Points

Layout points can be added to **Wires** to manually route them. This will override the automatic routing. To add a **Layout point**, right-click on the wire in the **Schematic View** and select **Add layout point**.  
<br />  
<img src="/components/wire-layout.png" width={634} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />
You can then drag the **Layout point** to adjust the wire's path.

<Callout>  
More than one **Layout point** can be added to a wire for more complex routing.

## Hide wire path

The **Hide Wire Path** feature improves schematic readability by visually breaking a **Wire**. This is useful when a **Wire** spans the full width of the schematic or crosses beneath other components. Hiding a wire has no effect on the physical harness and is purely for making the Schematic View visually cleaner.
<br />
To hide wire path, right-click a wire and select **Hide wire path** from the dropdown menu.  
<br />  
<img src="/components/wire-hide-path.png" width={611} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />
A **Hidden Wire** will show up as two arrows connected by a faint bezier line.

## Dashed Wires

Wires appear as dashed lines in the Schematic View when they are not yet routed through a bundle in the Layout View.  
<br />  
<img src="/components/wire-dashed.png" width={634} style={{ borderRadius: '8px' }} />

<Callout>  
You can hide the dashed lines by de-selecting **Dash undefined routes** from the Schematic **View Options** menu.

</Callout>

## Jumper Wire

A **Jumper Wire** (loopback wire) can be created by dragging from one cavity to another within the same connector in the **Schematic View**. 
<br />

<Callout>  
A **Jumper Wire** is considered to have a length of **zero**. You may need to account for this when generating length reports.
