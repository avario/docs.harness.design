# Wire

A **wire** represents an electrical connection between two components in the harness. Each wire can be assigned a [wire part](/parts/part-wire).

## Adding a Wire

In the [Schematic View](/quick-start/schematic), drag from the connection handle of one component to another to create a wire.

## Assigning Colour

If no part is assigned to a wire, you can manually set its colour. Right-click the wire in the Schematic, Layout, or Connection view and choose a colour from the menu.

## Wire Labels

To add labels, right-click a wire and select **Add labels** from the dropdown menu.

Wire labels are used to improve schematic readability by visually breaking a wireâ€”useful when a wire spans the full width of the schematic. Labels have no effect on the physical harness and are purely for visual reference.

## Dashed Wires

Wires appear as dashed lines in the Schematic View when they are not yet routed through a bundle in the Layout View.
