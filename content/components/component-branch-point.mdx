# Branch Point

A **branch point** is used to join multiple bundles together.

Inline components that are located within the harness—such as [splices](/components/component-splice), [diodes](/components/component-diode), and [resistors](/components/component-resistor)—can also be positioned at branch points.

Branch points can only be added in the [Layout View](/quick-start/layout).

## Adding Branch Points

There are several ways to add branch points to your harness:

<Steps>
### Add a New Branch Point  
Right-click on the canvas and select **Branch Point**. This will add a branch point with no connected bundles. Drag from the connection point of a connector, terminal, or another branch point to create a bundle to the new branch point.

### Add a Branch Point to a Bundle  
Right-click on a bundle and select **Add Branch Point**. This splits the bundle into two, with each segment connecting to the new branch point.

### Join Multiple Bundles with a Branch Point  
Select multiple bundles, right-click, and choose **Add Branch Point**. The selected bundles will be merged at a new branch point.
