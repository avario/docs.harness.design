# Components

In both the **Schematic** and **Layout** views, your harness is built using **components**.

Each component can later be assigned a specific **part** from the **Parts** view. Once assigned, the component is validated against the properties of that part.

This workflow allows you to design your schematic and layout using generic components first, then assign actual parts when ready.
