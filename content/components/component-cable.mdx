# Cable

A **cable** is a group of individual wires—called **cores**—wrapped in a sheath.

[Cable parts](/parts/part-cable) can be assigned to cables created in the [Schematic View](/quick-start/schematic).

## Adding a Cable

Right-click on the canvas in the Schematic View and select **Cable** to add a new cable.

### Create a Cable from Wires

Select multiple wires, right-click, and choose **Make cable**. This creates a cable with one core for each selected wire.

## Creating Cable Connections

Click and drag from a component's connection point to one of the cable's cores. Once two components are connected to the same core, a connection is established using that core as the conductor.

## Cable Routing

Cables are routed automatically based on connections and bundles. The cable length is determined by it's longest core.

## Adding and Removing Cable Cores

Select the cable in the Schematic View, then click the `+` button to add cores, or the `–` button to remove them.

## Adding a Shield to a Cable

Right-click the cable in the Schematic View and select **Add Shield**.

Shields can be connected to components just like wires.
