# Release - 23.01.2026

A major change was made to how wires are laid out in Schematic View, moving toward more manual control. Extensive optimisation means large schematics should now run much more smoothly.

This work lays critical groundwork for future features like idents, sub harnesses, and more.

### Wire Layout

We've completely overhauled how wires, cables, and bundles are laid out. Wires will now stay exactly where you put them. Auto Layout is still available if you want to quickly set things up. The workflow is much faster, with layout points being added by double clicking. You can now add layout points to hidden wires and cables.

**Note:** This change required migrating your existing designs to the new system. Most things should look the same, but some layouts may require minor adjustments.

### Optimisation

Significant performance improvements have been made to make large designs much more responsive. Instead of rendering everything, only what's in view is rendered. This is a simplification, but it gives you the idea.

### More Colours

A new sub menu adds more colour options for wires and stripes. This should help you get closer to matching your actual wire colours.

### Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Update

Google Analytics has been removed from the website, leaving only essential cookies required for site functionality. It wasn't providing much value, and it's nice not to have a cookie pop up anymore.

### Smaller Enhancements

- Wire parts are prioritised based on the current colour
- Added undo and redo to the user interface (people kept missing the keyboard shortcuts)

Because of the size of this update there may be some bugs we haven't caught. Please let us know if you find anything odd!
