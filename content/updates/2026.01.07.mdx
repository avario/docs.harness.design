# Release - 07.01.2026

Few new features improving useability and layout in the app. Let us know what you think!

### Layout Points Wires

We added layout points to wires to allow some level of manual routing. This should help clean up complex schematics.

### Layout Points Bundles

These work similar to the layout points for wires but for bundles and replace the need to add extra branch points.

### Moving Groups

We've adjusted the way groups work so you can now move them by dragging on the heading.
