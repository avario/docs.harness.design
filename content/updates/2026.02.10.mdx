### Save/Open from Local Data

You can now save your harness projects to local JSON files. Keep a record, manually modify them, scrape the data. Then load local files back into the editor when you need.

### Twisted Wires

We’ve added support for twisting wires together. This is very similar to a cable - but twisty.
